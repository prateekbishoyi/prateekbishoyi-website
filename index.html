        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Prateek Bishoyi and I am currently full-time student at University of California Riverside. I am majoring in statistics with a concentration in quantitative management. I originally entered as a Math major, so I have a decent experience dealing with various of sorts of equations when it comes to subjects such as calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. The many topics discussed within calculus that I have covered include introduction to differential calculus of functions of one variable, introduction to integral calculus of functions of one variable, topics from integral calculus, improper integrals, infinite series, Taylor's series, and Taylor's theorem, topics include Euclidean geometry, matrices and linear functions, determinants, partial derivatives, directional derivatives, Jacobians, gradients, chain rule, and Taylor's theorem for several variables. Some topics I covered in linear algebra include a study of matrices and systems of linear equations, determinants, Gaussian elimination, vector spaces, linear independence and linear transformation, orthogonality, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Lastly, differential equations which consist of introduction to first-order equations, linear second-order equations, and Laplace transforms, with applications to the physical and biological sciences. My main aspects of focus are on subjects involving statistics, economics, and business. I enjoy working with numbers and applying it to various topics such as the stock market, sports, and marketing. My experience in college canâ€™t go without my participation in various different types of activities. I participated in many different intramural sports such as basketball and soccer. I really value teamwork and there is something about leading and captaining a team that I find enjoyable. I really want to get work done and I hate losing is some my personal attributes. <br><br>

        I previously attended Diamond Bar High School before pursuing a higher education. At Diamond Bar High School I was very involved in numerous extracurricular activities.  I was a student volunteer for the City of Diamond Bar. I participated in volunteering for many different occasions such as the city birthday party. There I worked for about twenty-five hours working booths and helping hand out tickets and prizes for carnival games. I also enjoy sports back in high school and was on the water polo team. I competed in most of my league games and any tournaments my school signed us up for. My main source of volunteering was at a bookstore ran by the elderly. It was a non-profit organization that collected books and resold them to raise funds for our library. I worked over 250 hours shelving, categorizing, and pricing many different novels. I found all these activities personally fulfilling.<br><br>

       I have interned at Investorâ€™s Business Daily in the year of 2016. I worked in the Editorial Department at the Los Angeles home office. There I studied the IBD's CAN SLIM stock selection system. I used internal data and screening tools to find stock candidates for premium investing products, Leaderboard and SwingTrader. I found this experience very fulfilling because it gave me an insight into various different marketing aspects and helped me have my first dabble with the stock market.
